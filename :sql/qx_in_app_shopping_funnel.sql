-- QX: In-App Shopping Funnel Performance for H2 2024
-- Business Goal:
-- Measure the performance of the shopping funnel within the mobile app to estimate
-- engagement and purchase intent in the absence of a purchase traceability flag.
--
-- Logic:
-- 1. Identify active users in the app during H2 2024 (Julyâ€“December 2024).
-- 2. Count how many of them viewed at least one merchant in that period.
-- 3. Count how many of those viewers clicked on at least one merchant.
-- 4. Count how many of those clickers generated purchase intent (click on the same merchant seen in the same session).
-- 5. Calculate stage-to-stage conversion rates in the funnel.
--
-- Assumptions:
-- - Active user: any customer with at least one app session in H2 2024.
-- - Merchant view: event_type = 'merchant_view'.
-- - Merchant click: event_type = 'merchant_click'.
-- - Intent: merchant click on the same merchant previously viewed in the same session.
-- - Dates filtered from '2024-07-01' to '2024-12-31'.
--
-- Limitations:
-- - Without purchase traceability, we cannot confirm if intent resulted in an actual purchase.
-- - Events outside app_sessions are not considered.
--
-- Insight:
-- The in-app shopping funnel for H2 2024 shows a strong engagement flow:
-- - 93% of active users viewed at least one merchant.
-- - 78% of those viewers clicked on a merchant.
-- - 100% of clickers demonstrated purchase intent (clicking on the same merchant seen in the same session).
-- This indicates a healthy funnel with minimal drop-off between stages,
-- suggesting that increasing active users could directly increase overall conversions.
