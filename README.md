# SeQura BI Analyst - Technical Case

## üìå Introduction
This project contains the resolution of the **Technical Case** for the *Business Intelligence Analyst* position at **SeQura**.  
The case is divided into two main sections:
1. **SQL Exercises** ‚Üí Queries to answer specific business questions.
2. **Business Analysis & Recommendations** ‚Üí Visual report with insights and recommendations.

## üìÇ Data Preparation
Before starting the SQL queries, the dataset provided in the case study (Appendix) was delivered in a Word document, which is not directly suitable for SQL querying.  
To ensure all tables could be loaded into BigQuery and maintain data integrity, I prepared them manually in **Microsoft Excel** as follows:  

1. **Copying to Excel**  
   - Selected each table from the Word document.  
   - Pasted it into a new Excel workbook, one sheet per table.  

2. **Column structure review**  
   - Checked that each column had the correct header name according to the schema in the Appendix.  
   - Ensured that each value was in its correct column (no merged cells or extra line breaks).  

3. **Data format standardization**  
   - **Dates:** Converted all date fields to `YYYY-MM-DD` format.  
   - **Timestamps:** Standardized to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.  
   - **Decimals:** Ensured decimal separators used a dot `.` instead of a comma `,`.  
   - **Numeric IDs:** Confirmed they were integers without leading zeros.  
   - **Empty values:** Left blank cells for NULLs rather than using placeholders like `N/A`.  

4. **Data cleaning adjustments in Excel**  
   - Removed any accidental spaces before or after text values using Excel‚Äôs TRIM function.  
   - Verified that foreign keys (e.g., `customer_id` in `orders`) matched existing primary keys in their parent table.  
   - Checked that prices and amounts were stored as numeric values, not text.  

5. **Exporting to CSV**  
   - Saved each sheet as `CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv)` directly from Excel.  
   - Verified file encoding and delimiters.  

6. **Uploading to BigQuery**  
   - Created a dataset named `sequra_challenge`.  
   - Used **Create Table ‚Üí Upload CSV** for each file.  
   - Enabled ‚ÄúAutodetect schema‚Äù for initial import, then verified types (INT64, NUMERIC, DATE, TIMESTAMP, STRING).  

**Outcome:**  
All 7 tables (`customers`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`, `app_sessions`, `app_events`, `merchants`) were successfully loaded into BigQuery in CSV format, matching the original schema from the Appendix and ready for querying.

## üõ† Tools Used
- **BigQuery Sandbox** ‚Üí Query execution (data loaded manually from CSV due to sandbox limitations).
- **Visual Studio Code** ‚Üí Code organization and documentation.
- **Tableau Public** ‚Üí Visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Canva** ‚Üí Design of the final executive report.
- **GitHub** ‚Üí Repository for storing and versioning the project.

## üìä Part 1: SQL Solutions

Queries are stored in `/sql/` and documented with:
- **Business Goal**: What business question it answers.
- **Logic**: Steps followed in the query.
- **Assumptions**: If applicable.
- **Insights**: If applicable.

| Query | Description | SQL File | Results (CSV) |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Q1.1  | Countries with more than 3 customers, including customer count and average age. | [q1_1_customers_by_country.sql](./sql/q1_1_customers_by_country.sql) | [Download CSV](./results/q1_1_customers_by_country.csv) |
| Q1.2  | Monthly ticket value trend for 2024 with month-over-month growth percentage. | [q1_2_monthly_ticket_trend.sql](./sql/q1_2_monthly_ticket_trend.sql) |  [Download CSV](./results/q1_2_monthly_ticket_trend.csv) |
| Q2.1  | App engagement by platform (iOS vs Android) during H2 2024. | [q2_1_engagement_by_platform.sql](./sql/q2_1_engagement_by_platform.sql) | [Download CSV](./results/q2_1_engagement_by_platform.csv) |
| Q2.2  | Relationship between payment management usage and shopping portal engagement. | [q2_2_payment_vs_shopping_engagement.sql](./sql/q2_2_payment_vs_shopping_engagement.sql) | *(pending)* |
| Extra | Theoretical in-app purchase funnel. | [qx_in_app_shopping_funnel.sql](./sql/qx_in_app_shopping_funnel) | [Download CSV](./results/qx_in_app_shopping_funnel.csv) |

## üìà Part 2: Business Report
- **Format:** PDF (max. 3 pages).
- **Content:** Key visualizations + insights + actionable recommendations.
- **Suggested KPIs:**  
  - DAU / MAU by platform  
  - % of active users in Payment Management  
  - % of active users in Shopping Portal  
  - In-app funnel conversion rate

---

## üìù Assumptions
1. Dataset is simulated and manually loaded into BigQuery from CSV.
2. Engagement metric is calculated as the number of unique sessions or events per user.
3. Date filters applied according to `event_date` or equivalent field.
4. Monthly growth rate calculated as `(current month - previous month) / previous month`.
